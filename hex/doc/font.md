# Fonts

## Font parameters

1. slant per point: this dimension is used for the proper horizontal positioning of accents
2. interword space: used unless the user specifies an explicit \spaceskip
3. interword stretch: the stretch component of the interword space
4. interword shrink: the shrink component of the interword space
5. x-height: the value of the ⟨internal unit⟩ ex, which is usually about the height of the lowercase letter ‘x’
6. quad: the value of the ⟨internal unit⟩ em, which is approximately the width of the capital letter ‘M’
7. extra space: the space added to the interword space at the end of sentences (that is, when \spacefactor ≥ 2000) unless the user specifies an explicit \x-spaceskip
