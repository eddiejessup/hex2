  <h1>The TFM File Format</h1>
  <h2>0. Foreword</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of this page is to provide documentation for the
    <code>TFM</code> file format. Much of the content of this page was taken
    directly from the <code>tftopl.web</code> program, written by Donal Knuth
    (this explains the several references to the <code>TFtoPL</code> program;
    these can be ignored).
  </p>

  <h2>1. The <code>TFM</code> File Format</h2>
  <p>
    The idea behind <code>TFM</code> files is that typesetting routines like
    <code>TeX</code> need a compact way to store the relevant information about
    several dozen fonts, and computer centers need a compact way to store the
    relevant information about several hundred fonts. <code>TFM</code> files are
    compact, and most of the information they contain is highly relevant, so
    they provide a solution to the problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    The information in a <code>TFM</code> file appears in a sequence of 8-bit
    bytes. Since the number of bytes is always a multiple of 4, we could also
    regard the file as a sequence of 32-bit words; but <code>TeX</code> uses the
    byte interpretation, and so does <code>TFtoPL</code>. Note that the bytes
    are considered to be unsigned numbers.
  </p>

  <h2>2. File Header</h2>
  <p>
    The first 24 bytes (6 words) of a <code>TFM</code> file contain twelve
    16-bit integers that give the lengths of the various subsequent portions of
    the file. These twelve integers are, in order:
    <center>

          <td>number of font parameter words</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>
  </p>

  <p>They are all nonnegative and less than <code>2^15</code>. We must have</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>bc-1 &lt;= ec &lt; =255</code></li>
    <li><code>ne &lt;=256</code></li>
    <li><code>lf=6+lh+(ec-bc+1)+nw+nh+nd+ni+nl+nk+ne+np</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note that a font may contain as many as 256 characters (if
    <code>bc=0</code> and <code>ec=255</code>), and as few as 0 characters (if
    <code>bc=ec+1</code>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Incidentally, when two or more 8-bit bytes are combined to form an integer
    of 16 or more bits, the most significant bytes appear first in the file.
    This is called BigEndian order.
  </p>

  <h2>3. File Body</h2>

    The rest of the <code>TFM</code> file may be regarded as a sequence of ten
    data arrays having the informal specification

  <p>
    The most important data type used here is a <code>fix_word</code>, which is
    a 32-bit representation of a binary fraction. A <code>fix_word</code> is a
    signed quantity, with the two's complement of the entire word used to
    represent negation. Of the 32 bits in a <code>fix_word</code>, exactly 12
    are to the left of the binary point; thus, the largest
    <code>fix_word</code> value is <code>2048-2^{-20}</code>, and the smallest
    is -2048. We will see below, however, that all but one of the
    <code>fix_word</code> values will lie between -16 and +16.

    <a name="header"
      ><h3>3.1 The <code>header</code> Array</h3></a
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    The first data array is a block of header information, which contains
    general facts about the font. The header must contain at least two words,
    and for <code>TFM</code> files to be used with Xerox printing software it
    must contain at least 18 words, allocated as described below. When different
    kinds of devices need to be interfaced, it may be necessary to add further
    words to the header block.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>header[0]</code> is a 32-bit check sum that <code>TeX</code> will
      copy into the <code>DVI</code> output file whenever it uses the font.
      Later on when the <code>DVI</code> file is printed, possibly on another
      computer, the actual font that gets used is supposed to have a check sum
      that agrees with the one in the <code>TFM</code> file used by
      <code>TeX</code>. In this way, users will be warned about potential
      incompatibilities. (However, if the check sum is zero in either the font
      file or the <code>TFM</code> file, no check is made.) The actual relation
      between this check sum and the rest of the <code>TFM</code> file is not
      important; the check sum is simply an identification number with the
      property that incompatible fonts almost always have distinct check sums.
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>header[1]</code> is a <code>fix_word</code> containing the design
      size of the font, in units of <code>TeX</code> points (7227
      <code>TeX</code> points = 254 cm). This number must be at least 1.0; it is
      fairly arbitrary, but usually the design size is 10.0 for a ``10 point''
      font, i.e., a font that was designed to look best at a 10-point size,
      whatever that really means. When a <code>TeX</code> user asks for a font
      at <code>delta</code> pt, the effect is to override the design size and
      replace it by <code>delta</code>, and to multiply the <code>x</code> and
      <code>y</code> coordinates of the points in the font image by a factor of
      <code>delta</code> divided by the design size.
      <i
        >All other dimensions in the <code>TFM</code> file are
        <code>fix_word</code> <code>kern-1pt</code> numbers in design-size
        units.</i
      >
      Thus, for example, the value of <code>param[6]</code>, one
      <code>em</code> or <code>\quad</code>, is often the
      <code>fix_word</code> value <code>2^{20}=1.0</code>, since many fonts have
      a design size equal to one em. The other dimensions must be less than 16
      design-size units in absolute value; thus, <code>header[1]</code> and
      <code>param[1]</code> are the only <code>fix_word</code> entries in the
      whole <code>TFM</code> file whose first byte might be something besides 0
      or 255.
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>header[2..11]</code>, if present, contains 40 bytes that identify
      the character coding scheme. The first byte, which must be between 0 and
      39, is the number of subsequent ASCII bytes actually relevant in this
      string, which is intended to specify what character-code-to-symbol
      convention is present in the font. Examples are <code>ASCII</code> for
      standard ASCII, <code>TeX text</code> for fonts like
      <code>cmr10</code> and <code>cmti9</code>,
      <code>TeX math extension</code> for <code>cmex10</code>,
      <code>XEROX text</code> for Xerox fonts, <code>GRAPHIC</code> for
      special-purpose non-alphabetic fonts, <code>UNSPECIFIED</code> for the
      default case when there is no information. Parentheses should not appear
      in this name. (Such a string is said to be in <code>BCPL</code> format.)
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>header[12..16]</code>, if present, contains 20 bytes that name the
      font family (e.g., <code>CMR</code> or <code>HELVETICA</code>), in
      <code>BCPL</code> format. This field is also known as the ``font
      identifier.''
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>header[17]</code>, if present, contains a first byte called the
      <code>seven_bit_safe_flag</code>, then two bytes that are ignored, and a
      fourth byte called the <code>face</code>. If the value of the fourth byte
      is less than 18, it has the following interpretation as a ``weight, slope,
      and expansion'': Add 0 or 2 or 4 (for medium or bold or light) to 0 or 1
      (for roman or italic) to 0 or 6 or 12 (for regular or condensed or
      extended). For example, 13 is 0+1+12, so it represents medium italic
      extended. A three-letter code (e.g., <code>MIE</code>) can be used for
      such <code>face</code> data.
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>header[18..whatever]</code> might also be present; the individual
      words are simply called <code>header[18]</code>, <code>header[19]</code>,
      etc., at the moment.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <a name="charinfo"
    ><h3>3.2 The <code>char_info</code> Array</h3></a
  >
  <p>
    Next comes the <code>char_info</code> array, which contains one
    <code>char_info_word</code> per character. Each
    <code>char_info_word</code> contains six fields packed into four bytes as
    follows.
  </p>

  <table border="yes">

    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    The actual width of a character is <code>width[width_index]</code>, in
    design-size units; this is a device for compressing information, since many
    characters have the same width. Since it is quite common for many characters
    to have the same height, depth, or italic correction, the
    <code>TFM</code> format imposes a limit of 16 different heights, 16
    different depths, and 64 different italic corrections.
  </p>

  <p>
    Incidentally, the relation
    <code>width[0]=height[0]=depth[0]=italic[0]=0</code> should always hold, so
    that an index of zero implies a value of zero. The
    <code>width_index</code> should never be zero unless the character does not
    exist in the font, since a character is valid if and only if it lies between
    <code>bc</code> and <code>ec</code> and has a nonzero
    <code>width_index</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <code>tag</code> field in a <code>char_info_word</code> has four values
    that explain how to interpret the <code>remainder</code> field.

  <p>
    In a kern step, an additional space equal to
    <code>kern[256*(op_byte-128)+remainder]</code> is inserted between the
    current character and <code>next_char</code>. This amount is often negative,
    so that the characters are brought closer together by kerning; but it might
    be positive.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are eight kinds of ligature steps, having <code>op_byte</code> codes
    <code>4a+2b+c</code> where <code>0 &lt;= a &lt;= b+c </code> and
    <code>0 &lt;= b,c &lt;= 1</code>. The character whose code is
    <code>remainder</code> is inserted between the current character and
    <code>next_char</code>; then the current character is deleted if
    <code>b=0</code>, and <code>next_char</code> is deleted if <code>c=0</code>;
    then we pass over <code>a</code> characters to reach the next current
    character (which may have a ligature/kerning program of its own).
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice that if <code>a=0</code> and <code>b=1</code>, the current character
    is unchanged; if <code>a=b</code> and <code>c=1</code>, the current
    character is changed but the next character is unchanged.
    <code>TFtoPL</code> will check to see that infinite loops are avoided.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the very first instruction of the <code>lig_kern</code> array has
    <code>skip_byte=255</code>, the <code>next_char</code> byte is the so-called
    right boundary character of this font; the value of
    <code>next_char</code> need not lie between <code>bc</code> and
    <code>ec</code>. If the very last instruction of the
    <code>lig_kern</code> array has <code>skip_byte=255</code>, there is a
    special ligature/kerning program for a left boundary character, beginning at
    location <code>256*op_byte+remainder</code>. The interpretation is that
    <code>TeX</code> puts implicit boundary characters before and after each
    consecutive string of characters from the same font. These implicit
    characters do not appear in the output, but they can affect ligatures and
    kerning.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the very first instruction of a character's <code>lig_kern</code> program
    has <code>skip_byte &gt; 128</code>, the program actually begins in location
    <code>256*op_byte+remainder</code>. This feature allows access to large
    <code>lig_kern</code> arrays, because the first instruction must otherwise
    appear in a location <code>&lt;=255</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any instruction with <code>skip_byte &gt; 128</code> in the
    <code>lig_kern</code> array must have
    <code>256*op_byte+remainder &lt; nl</code>. If such an instruction is
    encountered during normal program execution, it denotes an unconditional
    halt; no ligature command is performed.

      ><h3>3.4 The <code>extensible_recipe</code> Array</h3></a
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    Extensible characters are specified by an <code>extensible_recipe</code>,
    which consists of four bytes called <code>top</code>, <code>mid</code>,
    <code>bot</code>, and <code>rep</code> (in this order). These bytes are the
    character codes of individual pieces used to build up a large symbol. If
    <code>top</code>, <code>mid</code>, or <code>bot</code>
    are zero, they are not present in the built-up result. For example, an
    extensible vertical line is like an extensible bracket, except that the top
    and bottom pieces are missing.

    <a name="param"
      ><h3>3.5 The <code>param</code> Array</h3></a
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    The final portion of a <code>TFM</code> file is the
    <code>param</code> array, which is another sequence of
    <code>fix_word</code> values.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>param[1]=slant</code> is the amount of italic slant, which is used
      to help position accents. For example, <code>slant=.25</code> means that
      when you go up one unit, you also go .25 units to the right. The
      <code>slant</code> is a pure number; it's the only
      <code>fix_word</code> other than the design size itself that is not scaled
      by the design size.
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>param[2]=space</code> is the normal spacing between words in text.
      Note that character <code>" "</code> in the font need not have anything to
      do with blank spaces.
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>param[3]=space_stretch</code> is the amount of glue stretching
      between words.
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>param[4]=space_shrink</code> is the amount of glue shrinking between
      words.
    </li>

    <li>
      <code>param[5]=x_height</code> is the height of letters for which accents
      don't have to be raised or lowered.
    </li>

    <li><code>param[6]=quad</code> is the size of one em in the font.</li>

    <li>
      <code>param[7]=extra_space</code> is the amount added to
      <code>param[2]</code> at the ends of sentences.
    </li>
